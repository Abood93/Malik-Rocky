amount to withdraw from ATM = amountWithdraw
amount in the account = amountAccount
amount dispensed to the customer = amountDisp
amount less than or equal to 300 = amountLessEq300
amount to withdraw more than 300 = amountOver300
total amount of money customer owes = debits
shortage of the money that is not in account = amountShort


if(amountWithdraw less than or equal 500)
 -amountAccount sufficient:
  >amountLessEq300: amountDisp
  >amountOver300: amountDisp, debits = amountOver300 * 0.04

-amountAccount insufficient:
  >amountLessEq300: amountDisp, debits = amountShort + 25
  >amountOver300: amountDisp, debits = (amountOver300 * 0.04) + amountShort + 25

-amountAccount empty or negative:
